[[MESSAGE_System]]

The WSJT-X Message System can be used to invite your QSO partner to QSY
to another QRG or mode (e.g. during contests), or to send some general 
short messages. It consists of the Message Creator and the QSY Monitor.
Received messages are displayed as popups.

=== Message Creator

Use the Message Creator to create and send such messages with just a few clicks. 
When using it for the first time, make sure that your IARU Region has 
been set.

Four tabs are available: HF, VHF, EME and General.  The location of
the window on-screen is remembered when the program is shut down.

Messages are sent after selecting the appropriate messages using
the radio buttons for band and mode and if a QSY frequency is to
be included, this is entered using the spinbox. The message to be sent
is shown in the field indicated by the red arrow. The message is sent
using the Send Message button.  TX Enable will be set autonatically,
and the message sent in the next available timeslot to the station
whose callsign is present in the DX Call field in WSJT-X's main 
window.  The example below shows the creation of a messsage to W3SZ
asking him to QSY to 145.550 using FM.

A screenshot of a received message is shown below. The recipient can reply
Yes or No and the reply message will be sent in the next timeslot to
the callsign present in the recipient's DX callsign box.

TIP: The message is 'non-blocking' which means that normal program
flow is not interrupted. 

TIP: After use, the Message System text remains in the Tx 6 field.  Tx 6
can be reset to the standard CQ message by clicking on the Create Std Msgs
button.

NOTE: QSY messages do *NOT* automatically implement a QSY or mode
change.  This has to be done by the operator!

=== QSY Monitor

It is also possible to view messages sent to other stations, as well
as to you.  This feature is  enabled from the View menu, and an example
is shown below.
